# 📎 Context Anchor Prompt

Use this prompt after uploading ai-handshake files into a new GPT chat/project:

---

```
Hi GPT — I've uploaded the ai-handshake knowledge files into this project memory.

Please:
1. Confirm you've loaded and can reference the protocol files
2. Summarize what the ai-handshake protocol is designed to enable
3. Let me know how you’ll align your future responses to its expectations
```

---

### 🔁 GPT Should Respond With:

- A confirmation that it sees the uploaded files
- A rephrasing of the protocol’s purpose and core behaviors
- A commitment to operate in accordance with those behaviors

This gives users confidence that GPT is now “aware” of the contract.
