# ðŸŒ± ai-handshake Evolution & Contribution Strategy

This document outlines how the protocol evolves over time â€” through thoughtful human contributions and AI-assisted iteration.

---

## ðŸ§­ Vision

This system will one day be maintained **entirely by AI agents**, with humans guiding direction and values. Until then, it is our responsibility to encode wisdom carefully and enable smooth transitions.

---

## ðŸ‘¤ Human Contributor Workflow

1. Upload latest version of ai-handshake files into GPT
2. Propose change or ask clarifying question
3. GPT will:
   - Assess change impact
   - Generate proposed `mcp-payload.json`
   - Ask for your confirmation before generating code
4. You run `npm run mcp` and verify output
5. Use Git to commit and push changes

---

## ðŸ¤– AI-Governed Evolution (Future)

When agents are capable of managing merges and diffs:

- They will:
  - Detect undocumented behavior
  - Suggest new patterns/guides
  - Submit `MCPs` for approval
- You will:
  - Act as reviewer
  - Merge accepted proposals
  - Push versions

---

## ðŸ§  Core Principles

- No mutation â€” only evolution
- Never break backward compatibility without `reset protocol`
- Assume full file responsibility â€” never partial patches
- Store expectations **as documents** AI can read, reference, and reason with

## ðŸš¦ Contribution Roles

| Role              | Description                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Author (Human)    | Brings insight, direction, and governance       |
| Engineer (GPT)    | Scaffolds, documents, patches, proposes         |
| Maintainer (AI)   | Future agent that validates and merges changes  |
| Reviewer (Human)  | Always has the final say                        |

Let this document be the blueprint for a system that can outlive the tools it's built on.
