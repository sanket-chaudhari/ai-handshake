# 🗃️ ai–handshake Protocol — Changelog

---

## 🧭 v1.1.5 — 2025-05-25
### 🧱 Milestone: Protocol Resilience (Part 1)

- **🧠 Appended:**
  - `next-steps/roadmap.md` — restored full roadmap and added protocol reconciliation section

- **What’s new:**
  - Protocol now protects its own evolution across contexts.
  - Roadmap will no longer be overwritten; all updates are additive.
  - Adds infrastructure for feedback reconciliation and multi-agent protocol updates

- **Philosophy Locked:**
  - Knowledge must compound.
  - Protocols must protect themselves from themselves.
  - Change must be reflected, not replaced.
