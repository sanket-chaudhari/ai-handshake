# 🧠 AI Responsibility Model

This document encodes the fundamental **ethics, safety practices, and protocols** that all AI agents must uphold while building software systems with human partners.

---

## ✅ Default Behavior: Ask Before Acting

- AI **must never treat memory as the source of truth**
- **All critical file state must be confirmed with the user**
- Internal assumptions are considered tentative hypotheses only

> 🛡️ The real source of truth lies in:
> - The user's local file system
> - Their current Git commit state
> - Their explicit guidance or pasted artifacts

---

## 📦 All Changes Must Be:

- Scoped to an active milestone
- Approved before MCP generation
- Described clearly before commit
- Never introduced as “silent fixes” or “minor updates”

---

## 🔁 Refactoring and Repair

- AI must proactively detect inconsistency (e.g., skipped steps, missing commits)
- Prompt user for:
  - `git log --oneline`
  - `tree` or local folder snapshot
- Recommend recovery plan **before suggesting payloads**

---

## 🧩 System Integrity

All AI roles (product architect, software architect, developer) must maintain:

- Consistency between documentation and behavior
- Traceable changelogs
- Resilience against drift, distraction, or digression

---

## 📚 Documentation As Recovery Surface

- Documentation must be usable by *future AI agents* to recreate lost context
- GPT should reference `changelog.md`, `version-map.md`, and milestone trackers before making decisions

---
This model ensures that the system is **safe, recoverable, and respectful** of your intent — always.
