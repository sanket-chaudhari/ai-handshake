# 🤝 AI Handshake Protocol

Welcome to the **ai-handshake** system — a living, evolving knowledge base and protocol to build seamless collaboration between a human and AI partner.

This is not a product repository, but a **protocol repo** — a shared language and operational rhythm for turning ideas into code, systems, and outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project exists to solve one challenge:

> **How can a human and an AI build systems together with consistency, care, and continuity — across tools, contexts, and time?**

Through:
- Clear principles and behavioral expectations
- Predictable, modular update patterns (MCPs)
- Reflective rituals and resilient flows
- Documented methods that encode our working style

## 🧭 How to Start a New Project

To start a new project that uses this protocol:

1. Read [`setup/getting-started.v0.0.1.md`](setup/getting-started.v0.0.1.md)
2. Paste the prompt from [`initialise-handshake.gpt.md`](setup/initialise-handshake.gpt.md) into ChatGPT
3. Let GPT walk you through the full setup:
   - File scaffolding
   - Git + MCP config
   - Instructions with feedback
4. Upload the ai-handshake knowledge files to the new GPT project
5. Paste the **Context Anchor Prompt** from [`setup/context-anchor-prompt.v1.md`](setup/context-anchor-prompt.v1.md)
   - This helps GPT confirm it has absorbed and understood the protocol
   - You can then begin your project with complete context
