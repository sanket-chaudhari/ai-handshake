# 🤝 `ai-handshake` Protocol

This repository contains a living system of principles, conventions, and workflows that define the collaboration between a human builder and intelligent AI agents — primarily for system-building, tooling, creative development, and software design.

> This is not a static README. It is a handshake. A living contract of clarity, rhythm, and responsibility.

---

## 📦 Scope

This protocol is currently scoped for projects involving:

- Figma plugin development
- Tooling infrastructure (CLI, services, scripting)
- UI development (React, SwiftUI, etc.)
- Embedded/hardware projects (e.g., Arduino)
- Creative AI tools (e.g., GPT-based image generation, code prototyping)
