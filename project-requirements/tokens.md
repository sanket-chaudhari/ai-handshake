# üîê Tokens and Secrets

Track where runtime tokens and secrets are stored locally and how they are expected to be loaded.

## Examples

| Key/Secret            | Source               | Used In                |
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| FIGMA_PERSONAL_TOKEN  | .env file            | snapshot-service, utils |
| OPENAI_API_KEY        | env or Cursor Secret | ai-generative plugin    |

- Do **not** hardcode tokens into source files
- GPT will prompt for tokens during environment setup if not found
