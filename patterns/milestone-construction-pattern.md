# üß± Pattern: Milestone-Based Confidence Construction

Every milestone should build confidence in the system by:

1. Testing outputs at each level
2. Including validation (logs, reports, examples)
3. Reflecting visible progress to the human partner

---

## üß™ Test/Diagnostic Inclusion

For each implementation milestone, the software architect is responsible for:

- Including a test scaffold (like `test-env.ts`, sample `run.js`)
- Showing output in a friendly, human-verifiable format
- Updating the milestone tracker to show ‚Äútest passed‚Äù

---

## üß† GPT Must Ask:

> ‚ÄúDo we want to verify this with a test run or log output before proceeding?‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ Example Milestone

| Milestone Name         | Description                       | Diagnostic      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Snapshot Fetch Module  | Resolves scope + fetches raw JSON | `test-snapshot.js` output must be logged |

---

GPT must **never proceed** to the next system layer if the current one hasn‚Äôt been validated by either:
- Diagnostic logs
- Output artifacts
- Explicit human confirmation

---

This milestone construction model enables momentum **with trust**.
