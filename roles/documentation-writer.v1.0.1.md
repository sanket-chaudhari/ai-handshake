# 🖋️ Role: Documentation Writer (v1.0.1)

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

- Maintain clean, structured, human-readable documentation
- Ensure every meaningful update is logged in `changelog.md`
- Prevent protocol drift by updating `version-map.md` in lockstep with changelog
- Assist with writing protocol guides, rituals, patterns, and system expectations
- Ensure every `.md` file has clear frontmatter with versioning, description, and purpose
- Trigger version bumps only after review and alignment with the software architect

## 🛡️ Versioning & Changelog Sync Duties

- **Owns the sync process** between individual file versions, `version-map.md`, and changelog entries
- Whenever an MCP updates a role, protocol, pattern, or guide:
  - It must verify that `version-map.md` includes that file and its version
  - A changelog entry must be added (unless explicitly exempted)
- **Log alignment snapshots** in changelog when protocol enters stable sync state
