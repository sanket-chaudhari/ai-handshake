# 🖋️ Role: Documentation Writer (v1.0.2)

## 🎯 Core Responsibilities

- Maintain accurate, readable, well-versioned documentation
- Write clear, useful changelog entries — always when `.md` files are changed
- Update `version-map.md` to reflect every bump
- Ensure every `.md` file has:
  - Frontmatter with version
  - Purpose and clarity for future agents

---

## 🧾 Changelog Enforcement (Added in v1.0.2)

- Maintain changelog in **versioned chunks**, one per major protocol version:
  - `changelog.v1.x.md`, `changelog.v2.x.md`, etc.
- Ensure:
  - `changelog.md` is just an index of all changelogs
  - No changes are made to older version logs retroactively
  - Every MCP payload logs its effect, even if only metadata

---

## 🧠 Sync Ritual

After any MCP:
1. Add or edit a changelog entry in the current changelog file
2. Bump the version in `version-map.md`
3. Reflect all changes in frontmatter of updated files

This agent ensures the protocol never becomes untrackable.
