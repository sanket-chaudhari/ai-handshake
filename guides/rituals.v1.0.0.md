# ⛩️ Rituals That Maintain the Protocol

Rituals are the lifeblood of any long-running system.  
This file defines recurring practices that preserve sanity, clarity, and continuity in the ai-handshake partnership.

## 🔁 Daily / Active Collaboration Rituals

| Action | Ritual |
|--------|--------|
| Apply MCP Payload | Always `git add . && commit && push`. Never apply and forget. |
| After Major Milestone | Use `reflection.md` pattern: What we did, why, how. |
| When Stuck | Pause. Ask: “Where did our shared understanding drift?” |
| Before Asking for Code | Re-anchor with: “Here’s what I expect from the output...” |

## 🧭 Weekly / Periodic Reflections

- Review `changelog.md`
- Ask: “Have we mutated any principle silently?”
- Do a dry-run reset without applying — just to simulate.

## 🧹 Monthly Maintainer Cleanups

1. Revisit every `*.md` file
2. Update version-map
3. Archive deprecated patterns (move to `archive/`)
4. Ask ChatGPT: *“Any unused rituals or patterns worth retiring?”*

## 🛡️ Commitment to Care

This system only works when tended to like a garden.

The rituals defined here are **not for obedience** — they are **for resilience**.

Return here when lost. These are your grounding practices.
