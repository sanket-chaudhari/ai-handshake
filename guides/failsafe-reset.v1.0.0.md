# 🧯 Failsafe Reset Protocol

This document captures the ritual and instruction set for safely **resetting the state of the ai-handshake protocol** when drift or irreversible misalignment occurs.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

In systems where AI and humans co-build over long sessions, **drift is inevitable**:
- A file is updated without reflecting it elsewhere.
- A behavior changes but the documentation doesn't.
- The spirit of collaboration is lost in procedural fog.

This protocol restores clarity.

---

## 🧼 What "Reset" Means

- **Reset does NOT delete prior versions.**
- It means: We **freeze the current version**, fork forward into a new `vX.Y.Z`, and rebootstrap with new insight.

---

## 🔁 Reset Ritual

### Step 1: Pause

Stop development. Capture current context. Note where things feel wrong or unsalvageable.

### Step 2: Archive Current State

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b reset/v2.0.0
```

### Step 3: Define Breakpoint

In `changelog.md`, log:
- Why reset was initiated
- What was misaligned
- What will change in `v2.0.0`

### Step 4: Bootstrap Clean Protocol

Apply new MCP payload as `v2.0.0`. Carry over only what is consciously chosen to be retained.

## 🧭 Maintainer Notes

- A reset is a sign of maturity — not failure.
- You do not need permission from anyone but yourself to declare one.
- This protocol allows a **rebirth with clarity**.
